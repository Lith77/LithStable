LithStable, Summons a random favorite mount
V1.0.5:
	- Fix for Cataclysm mounts
	- Added support for aquatic mounts, so if in water and you have a aquatic favorite mount that can be used in that area it will summon that, as long as you don't use the Flying or Ground specific slash command or keybind.
V1.0.4:
	- Added options that are saved shared or per character
	- Addon now keeps track of last used flying and ground mount.
	- Option to dismount only if already mounted, if that is checked you need to use the command twice to get a new mount.
	- Option to ignore the functionality that removes the last used mount from the next random summon.
V1.0.3:
	- Tweaked the code for choosing the random mount
	- Fixed the code so the "Summon Flying mount" force a flying to be summoned if possible, otherwise a random ground mounts is used.
	
V1.0.2:
	- Added a check to see if the required flight skill is learned, including Cold Weather Flying and Flight Master's License. If not, it summons one of the favorite ground mounts (on Summon Auto keybind, Mount Journal button, or /ls).
	- Added two more keybindings for those who want to have one for flying and one for ground mounts.
	- Changed the icons in the Mount Journal.
	- Moved the icon for toggle favorite, now placed next to the summon random mount (auto) button in the Mount Journal.

V1.0.1:
	- User-Friendly Interface: LithStable integrates seamlessly with the existing Mount Journal UI, adding two new buttons for summoning a random mount and toggling favorites.
	- Customizable Key Bindings: Define a key binding for summoning a random favorite mount, making it even quicker to access your mounts.
	- Slash Command Support: Use the slash command /ls to summon a random favorite mount.

Let the stable boy fetch your favorite mount and ride in style!
