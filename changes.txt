LithStable, Summons a random favorite mount
V1.0.3:
	- Tweaked the code for choosing the random mount
	- Fixed the code so the "Summon Flying mount" force a flying to be summoned if possible, falling back to a ground mount if not.
	
V1.0.2:
	- Added a check to see if the required flight skill is learned, including Cold Weather Flying and Flight Master's License. If not, it summons one of the favorite ground mounts (on Summon Auto keybind, Mount Journal button, or /ls).
	- Added two more keybindings for those who want to have one for flying and one for ground mounts.
	- Changed the icons in the Mount Journal.
	- Moved the icon for toggle favorite, now placed next to the summon random mount (auto) button in the Mount Journal.

V1.0.1:
	- User-Friendly Interface: LithStable integrates seamlessly with the existing Mount Journal UI, adding two new buttons for summoning a random mount and toggling favorites.
	- Customizable Key Bindings: Define a key binding for summoning a random favorite mount, making it even quicker to access your mounts.
	- Slash Command Support: Use the slash command /ls to summon a random favorite mount.

Let the stable boy fetch your favorite mount and ride in style!
